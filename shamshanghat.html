                        However this is where people never like to come
                        Today, we will talk about one such modern crematorium which is situated on the Ganges Ghat in
                        Bhogaon village.
                        Here people come from very far away to cremate the dead body.
                        My grandfather often says
                        Human has true knowledge at the cremation ground
                        Probably this would have been the meaning of what he said. A person is surrounded by many types
                        of attachment in his life, such as the greed of wealth, the greed of the son etc.

                        While death is a true truth, after death, everyone has to come one day or the other.
                        There is no problem of opening or closing of this crematorium, you can come here anytime to burn
                        the body.
                        It is 5 km south of Aurai.
